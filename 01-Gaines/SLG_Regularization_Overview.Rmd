4. Implementation


# Review & Notation ##

## Supervised Learning ##

Recall from Justin's talk:

- Both inputs (features or predictors) & an output (response) are observed
- Want to build a learner (model) to understand the relationship between the 
  two 
    - Often interested in prediction

## Notation ##

- ${y}_i$: output or response variable
    - $i = 1,...,n$
- $x_{ij}$: input, predictor, or feature variable
    - $j = 1,...,p$

Matrix notation  

$\pmb{y} = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n \end{pmatrix} \quad$ and 
$\quad \pmb{X} = 
  \begin{pmatrix} 
    x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\ 
    x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\ 
    \vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\ 
    x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \cdots & x_{np} 
  \end{pmatrix}$

## Predictor Standardization ##
 
For regularized regression, predictors should be standardized before estimation

- Done using the classic "z-score" formula
- Puts each predictor on the same scale
    - Mean of 0 and variance of 1
    - Importance will be more clear later
    
- Use $\hat{\beta_0} = \bar{y}$ and estimate other coefficients 
    - Can transform back to original scale after estimation

## Estimation Goals ##

Given $\pmb{X}$, find a function, $f(\pmb{X})$, to model or predict $Y$
 
- Loss function, $L(y, f(\pmb{X}))$
    - Determines adequacy of fit
    - Squared error loss is most common  

\[L(y, f(\pmb{X})) = (y - f(\pmb{X}))^2 \]

- Choose $f$ by minimizing the expected loss
\[  E[(Y - f(\pmb{X}))^2] \]
    - $\Rightarrow f = E[Y | \pmb{X} = \pmb{x}]$ 

## Linear Regression ##

Assume $E[Y | \pmb{X} = \pmb{x}]$ is a linear function, 
  $\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j = \pmb{x}_i'\pmb{\beta}$

- $Y_i = \beta_0 + x_{i1}\beta_1 + x_{i2}\beta_2 + \dots + x_{ip}\beta_p 
         + \epsilon$

- Estimate $\pmb{\beta}$ using ordinary least squares (OLS)
\[\hat{\pmb{\beta}} = 
  \argmin_{\pmb{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j)^2 \\
  = \argmin_{\pmb{\beta}} \| \pmb{y} - \pmb{X}\pmb{\beta} \|^2_2\]
\[\Rightarrow \hat{\pmb{\beta}}^{OLS} = (\pmb{X}'\pmb{X})^{-1} \pmb{X}'\pmb{y} 
  \Rightarrow \hat{f}(\pmb{x}_i) = \pmb{x}_i'\hat{\pmb{\beta}}\]


# Motivation | Why is regularization needed? #

## Linear Regression Shortcomings ##

Despite its wide use and elegant theory, linear regession has its shortcomings

- Prediction accuracy
    - Often can be improved upon

- Model interpretability
    - Linear model does not automatically do variable selection

## Assessing Prediction Accuracy ##

Given a new input, $\pmb{x}_0$, how do we assess our prediction 
$\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0)$?

- Expected Prediction Error (EPE)
    - $$ \begin{aligned} 
    EPE(\pmb{x}_0) &= E[(Y_0 - \hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0))^2] \\
                   &= \text{Var}(\epsilon) + \text{Var}(\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0))
                      + \text{Bias}(\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0))^2 \\
                   &= \text{Var}(\epsilon) + MSE(\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0))
    \end{aligned} $$
    - $\text{Var}(\epsilon)$: irreducible error variance
    - $\text{Var}(\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0))$: sample-to-sample variability of 
                                        $\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0)$ 
    - $\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0))$: average difference of 
                                         $\hat{f}(\pmb{x}_0)$ & $f(\pmb{x}_0)$
    
## Estimating Prediction Error ##

Common approach to estmating prediction error

- Randomly split data into "training" and "test" sets
    - Test set has $m$ observations
- Calculate $\hat{f}$ using training data
- Estimate prediction error using test set MSE
\[ \widehat{MSE}(\hat{f}) = 
  \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \hat{f}(x_i))^2  \]

Why?

- Want our model/predictions to perform well with new/future data

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff ##

## Improving Prediction Accuracy ##

If $f(x) \approx \text{linear}$, $\hat{f}$ will have low bias but possibly
  high variance

- Correlated predictors 
- $p \approx n$ or high-dimensional setting where $p > n$
\

Want to minimize \[MSE(\hat{f}(x)) = \text{Var}(\hat{f}(x)) + 
\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(x))^2\]

- Sacrifice bias to reduce variance
    - Hopefully leads to decrease in $MSE$
- Regularization allows us to tune this trade-off

## Variable Selection ##

Often interested in using only a subset of the predictors

- Want to identify the most relevant predictors
    - Usually the big picture is of interest
- Helps avoid an overly complex model that is difficult to interpret 

Linear regression does not directly determine which predictors to use

How do we choose which predictors to use?

- Theory or expertise
- Ad hoc trial and error using p-values


## Automatic Subset Selection Methods ##
- Best subset
- Forward or backward stepwise
- Forward stagewise
    - Pick the best subset using test set prediction $MSE$, $C_p$, AIC, or BIC
 
Still not ideal

- Discrete process: predictor is either included or excluded
    - Unstable & highly variable
- Regularization is more continuous, & less variable as a result
  

# Regularized Regression | What is regularization? #

## Regularization Framework ##

Same setup as before

- Given $\pmb{X}$, find a function, $f(\pmb{X})$, to model or predict $y$
- Assume linear model and use squared error loss

Add second term to minimization

\[\hat{\pmb{\beta}}(\lambda) = \argmin_{\beta} 
  \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j)^2 
  + \lambda J(\pmb{\beta})\right\}\]

- $\lambda \ge 0$ is a regularization (tuning or penalty) parameter
- $J(\pmb{\beta})$ is a user-defined penalty function
    - Typically, the intercept is not penalized
 
## Role of the Penalty Term ##

Consider $\displaystyle J(\pmb{\beta}) = \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2 = 
  \| \pmb{\beta} \|^2_2 \hspace{0.2cm}$ (Ridge Regression)

Equivalent formulations
\[\hat{\pmb{\beta}}(\lambda)^{RR} = \argmin_{\pmb{\beta}} 
  \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j)^2 + 
  \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2 \right\}\]

\[\hat{\pmb{\beta}}(t)^{RR} = \argmin_{\pmb{\beta}} 
  \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j)^2 \\ 
  \text{subject to} \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2 \le t\] 

## Role of the Regularization Parameter ##

$\lambda$ directly controls the bias-variance trade-off:

- $\lambda = 0$ corresponds to OLS
- $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ puts more weight on the penalty function and 
  results in more shrinkage of the coefficients 
    - Introduce bias at the sake of reducing variance

Each $\lambda$ results in a different solution $\hat{\pmb{\beta}}(\lambda)$  

- Choosing $\lambda$ correctly is crucial (discussed later)

## The Lasso ##

Tibshirani (1996): Uses $\displaystyle J(\pmb{\beta}) = \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j| = 
  \| \pmb{\beta} \|_1$

\[\hat{\pmb{\beta}}(\lambda)^{L} = \argmin_{\beta} 
  \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j)^2 + 
  \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j| \right\}\]

The subtle change in the penalty makes a big difference

- Not only shrinks coefficients towards zero, but sets some of them to be 
  exactly zero
    - Thus performs continuous variable selection
    - Hence the name, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
([LASSO](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso.html "Tibshirani's Lasso Page"))

## General Regularization Framework ##

\[\min_{f \in \mathcal{H}} \sum_{i=1}^n \left\{L(y_i, f(x_i)) + 
  \lambda J(f)\right\} \]

- $\mathcal{H}$ is a space of possible functions

Very general and flexible framework

- $L$: squared error, absolute error, zero-one, negative log-likelihood (GLM),
  hinge loss (support vector machines), ...
- $J$: ridge regression, lasso, adaptive lasso, group lasso, fused lasso, 
  thesholded lasso, generalized lasso, constrained lasso, elastic-net, 
  dantzig selector, SCAD, smoothing splines, ...
    - Allows us to incorporate prior knowledge (sparsity, structure, etc.)


# Implementation | How is regularization actually used? #

## Example: NCAA Dataset ##

- From Mangold, Bean, & Adams (2003) via 
  [Dr. Dennis Boos](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/ "Link to NCAA Dataset") 
- Contains information on 94 major NCAA division I universities
    - $y$: average 6-year graduation rate for 1996-1998
    - $bbindex$: author-created basketball index
    - $attend$: average basketball attendance
    - 17 other predictors suggested by the literature
        - Acceptance rate, student-to-faculty ratio, etc.

Goal: Use OLS, ridge regression, and the lasso to find the best predictive
   model

Implementation: `glmnet` package in R

- Code available on 
[SLG website](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/reading/index "Link to R Code")

## Computational Considerations

Regularized regression estimates are a function of $\lambda$

Fortunately efficient algorithms exist

- Solution path algorithms
    - LARS Algorithm for the Lasso (Efron et al., 2004)
    - Piecewise linearity (Rosset & Zhu, 2007)
    - Generaic path algorithm (Zhou & Wu, 2013)
    
- Others
    - Pathwise coordinate descent (Friedman et al., 2007)
    - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) (Boyd et al. 2011)
    
## Lasso Solution Path
```{r lassopath, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.height=5.8, fig.width=8.5}
### Plot Solution Path ###
# Lasso
plot(fitLasso,xvar="lambda", label="TRUE")
# add label to upper x-axis
mtext("# of Nonzero (Active) Coefficients", side=3, line=2.5)
```

## Ridge Regression Solution Path
```{r ridgepath, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.height=5.8, fig.width=8.5}
### Plot Solution Path ###
# Ridge
plot(fitRidge,xvar="lambda", label="TRUE")
# add label to upper x-axis
mtext("# of Nonzero (Active) Coefficients", side=3, line=2.5)
```


## Choice of Regularization Parameter
Efficiently obtaining the entire solution path is nice, but we still have to 
  choose $\lambda$

- Critical since $\lambda$ constrols the bias-variance tradeoff

Traditional model selection methods

- $C_p$, AIC, BIC, adjusted $R^2$

Cross validation is a popular alternative

- Choice based on predictive performance
- Makes fewer model assumptions
- More widely applicable
  

## Cross Validation Motivation
Ideally:
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/trainValTest.png"  height="100" width="800">
</p>
- Separate validation set for choosing $\lambda$ for a given method
    - Reusing training set encourages overfitting
    - Using test set to pick $\lambda$ underestimates the true error

- Often we do not have enough data for a seperate validation set
    - Cross validation remedies this problem

## $K$-Fold Cross Validation

1. Randomly split training data into $K$ parts ("folds")
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/cvFolds.png"  height="150" width="700">
</p>
2. Fit model using data in $K-1$ folds for multiple $\lambda\text{s}$
3. Calculate prediction MSE on remaining fold
4. Repeat process for each fold and average the MSEs

- Common choices of $K$: 5, 10, and $n$ (leave-one-out CV)
- One standard error rule
    - Choose $\lambda$ corresponding to smallest model with MSE within
      one standard error of the minimum MSE

## Lasso 10-Fold Cross Validation
```{r lassocv, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.height=5.8, fig.width=8.5}
#### 10-fold cross validation ####
# Lasso
set.seed(seed)  # set seed 
# (10-fold) cross validation for the Lasso
cvLasso = cv.glmnet(XTrain, yTrain, alpha = 1)
plot(cvLasso)
mtext("# of Nonzero (Active) Coefficients", side=3, line=2.5)
```

```{r ridgecv, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.show='hide'}
#### 10-fold cross validation ####
# Ridge Regression
set.seed(seed)  # set seed 
# (10-fold) cross validation for Ridge Regression
cvRidge = cv.glmnet(XTrain, yTrain, alpha = 0)
plot(cvRidge)
```

## Final Models ##
```{r testerror, echo=FALSE}
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#
### Determine final models ###

#### Extract Coefficients ####
# OLS coefficient estimates
betaHatOLS = fitOLS$coefficients
# Lasso coefficient estimates 
betaHatLasso = as.double(coef(fitLasso, s = cvLasso$lambda.1se))  # s is lambda
# Ridge  coefficient estimates 
betaHatRidge = as.double(coef(fitRidge, s = cvRidge$lambda.1se))



#### Test Set MSE ####
# calculate predicted values

# For some reason, the predict function was not working correctly for OLS
# One suggestion was to include the test response (yTrain) in the test set...
# data.frame with the same name as the original response, but this didn't work
# predOLS =  predict(fitOLS, 
#                      newdata = as.data.frame(cbind(XTest, yTrain = yTest)))

XTestOLS = cbind(rep(1, nrow(XTest)), XTest) # add intercept to test data
predOLS = XTestOLS%*%betaHatOLS 
predLasso = predict(fitLasso, s = cvLasso$lambda.1se, newx = XTest)
predRidge = predict(fitRidge, s = cvRidge$lambda.1se, newx = XTest)

# calculate test set MSE
testMSEOLS = mean((predOLS - yTest)^2)
testMSELasso = mean((predLasso - yTest)^2)
testMSERidge = mean((predRidge - yTest)^2)
#### End ####

## Summary ##

Traditional linear model is useful but has its shortcomings

- Prediction accuracy
- Model interpretability 


Regularization adds a penalty term to the estimation

- Able to exploit the bias-variance trade-off
- Certain penalties allow for continuous variable selection
- Very flexible, able to incorporate prior knowledge
