Statistical Learning Group, Fall 2014
========

SLG is a reading group at North Carolina State University organized by [Dr. Justin Post](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/) and PhD Statistics students Jami Jackson, Brian Gaines, [Neal Grantham](http://nsgrantham.github.io), and [Josh Day](http://joshday.github.io).

## Goals of the group

1. Introduce advanced topics in data mining, machine learning, and other 'active' areas of statistics in order to broaden our knowledge base and, where possible, connect statistical ideas.
	- With the "Big Data" revolution upon us, these methods are becoming more important than ever.
	- For Fall 2014 we have chosen to read [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) as well as the slightly lower level [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).
	- Both of these books are free to download.
2. Offer opportunities to present upper level topics and improve presentation and teaching ability with a focus on audience of the presentation and data visualizations.
	- There will be 10 presentations made in fall 2014 (see below).
	- Presenting 'mentors' will be available for the presenters.
3. Give outlets for presentation, writing, and computing that are available for prospective employers to view.
	- Each presentation will be recorded and made available (if ok'd by presenter).
	- Write-ups and code will also be available.
4. Improve applied analysis skills and coding.
	- Every presentation will include an analysis or simulation aspect with code available for all members to work with.
	
## Introduction

Watch Neal's introduction to SLG [here](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/reading/index) and see `Overview.pdf`, Justin's slides on an introduction to statistical learning slides (Sadly, Justin's talk is not available online because the video camera battery died halfway through, but we've learned our lesson!).
